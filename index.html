		<h1> What is Love in America?</h1>
		
		<h2> We've all heard that approximately 50% of all marriages end in divorce, however
		 is there a geographic trend in which states have the highest rates?
		 This project is intended to look at US Census data regarding relationships in respect
		 to marriage, divorce, widowing, never having married, and how many households have at
